# HelathDietManagment-Python(File)
You can log and retrieve health and diet data of customer. Let assume we need to manage 3 customer's Helath and Diet. We need to add their health and diet 
in the text file. When we are adding/logging data,along with data the logging time also will be added. We can retrieve data.   You do no need create any file.
You just need to run this file on command line or through pycharm(I suggest you to put code file( m.py) inside a empty folder so that it will be easy to acess all the files)
This program is for 3 cutomers(Zeba,Sherry,Ram)
